/**
 * A middleware is sitting between the start of the request handling process and the final {@link Handler}, providing
 * access to the entire {@link Exchange}, and the ability to things before the request gets handled, or after the
 * request got already handled by the {@link Handler handler}.
 *
 * These middlewares are composable. For example, having the following code:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Handler handler = (exchange) -> LOG.info("hello");
 * Middleware m1 = (next) -> (exchange) -> {
 *     LOG.info("executing m1 before");
 *     next.handle(exchange);
 *     LOG.info("executing m1 after");
 * };
 * Middleware m2 = (next) -> (exchange) -> {
 *     LOG.info("executing m2 before");
 *     next.handle(exchange);
 *     LOG.info("executing m2 after");
 * };
 *
 * Handler final = m2.around(m1.around(handler));
 * handler.handle(new Exchange());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * would result in the following log messages (in order):
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * executing m2 before
 * executing m1 before
 * hello
 * executing m1 after
 * executing m2 after
 * }</pre>
